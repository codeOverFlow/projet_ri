My baby says she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, only fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

Picked up my bags, run to the station
Railman says you got the wrong location
Picked up the bag, run right home
Then I find I got the number wrong

Well, said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909, yeah

Picked up my bags, run to the station
Railman says you got the wrong location
Picked up my bags, run right home
Then I find I got the number wrong

Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's traveling on the one after 90
She said she's traveling on the one after 90
She said she's traveling on the one after 909

{Oh Danny boy, the old [incomprehensible] calling}
