Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt, therefore I am, harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift, pulsing with the earth
Company we keep, roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill is the air, cold as steel tonight
We shift, call of the wild
Fear in your eyes, it's later than you realized

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

I feel a change
Back to a better day, shape shift
Hair stands on the back of my neck, shape shift
Wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I have been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of wolf and man
