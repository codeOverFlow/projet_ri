It blows my mind
Because the wind is high

Love is old, love is you

Because the sky is blue
It makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him

Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him
You can go with him, girl
Go with him 
Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I gotta do

And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissing you

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true

She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalise
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

Don't take chances
If your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

She's got the devil in her heart
No, she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No, she's an angel sent to me 
Since she's been gone
I want no one
To talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame
It's plain to see

So go away and leave me alone
Don't bother me

I can't believe
That she would leave
Me on my own
It's just not right
When every night
I'm all alone

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But 'til she's here
Please don't come near
Just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But 'til she's here
Please don't come near
Just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
