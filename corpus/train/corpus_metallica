Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of mother earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend, never

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate, it's worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been

Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore, never

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened, blackened

Lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take your breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun, never

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead

Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened, blackened

Claustrophobic, crawl out of this skin
High explosive, reach and pull that pin
Fear thy name extermination
Desecrating hail of fire

So we cross that line
Into the crypt, total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision, prophecy reveal
Death magnetic, pulling closer still
Fear thy name annihilation
Desolating hail of fire

So we cross that line
Into the crypt, total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse, go!

Crushing metal ripping skin
Tossing body mannequins
Spilling blood bleeding gas

Mangled flesh snapping spines
Dripping bloody valentine
Shattered face spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Split
Spit it out!

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know what time to cross over?
Want to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, the bones they are rattled
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, the bones they all shatter
It's past time to see the end in me
See the end in me!

Claustrophobic, climb out of this skin
High explosive, reach and pull that pin
Violate, annihilate, lose into my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate, if not accept, deny

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny in hail of fire

So we cross that line
Into the crypt, total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrants awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery, battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery, battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery, battery
Battery, battery

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, it's sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

Needlework the way, never betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master, master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies

Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries, fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

[laughter]

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free

Fearless wretch insanity
He watches lurking beneath the sea
Great old one forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal in madness you dwell

Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal in madness you dwell

In madness you dwell

Not dead, which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die

Drain you off your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches lurking beneath the sea
Great old one forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal in madness you dwell

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged

Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Can I breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane

They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on, natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air, got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out again
