Wash your face in the morning sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touch down bass living on the run
I make no sweat at the hole that you're digging

Wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to capital city in the sun

Kicking up a storm
From the day that I was born
Sing a song to me, one from Let It Be
Open up your eyes, get a grip on yourself inside

So wash your face in the morning sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touch down bass living on the run
Make no sweat of the hole that you're digging

Kicking up a storm
From the day that I was born
Sing a song for me, one from Let It Be
Open up your eyes, get a grip on yourself inside

Inside
Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside
You betcha

You betcha

So wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Please sit down, you make me feel giddy
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to Capital City

Been kicking up a storm
From the day that I was born
Sing a song for me, one from Let It Be
Open up your eyes, get a grip on yourself inside

Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
What was that sound ringing around your brain
Today was just a blur, you've got a head like a ghost train
What was that sound ringing around your brain
You're here on your own, who you gonna find to blame

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care
Because you're living fast

You're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking about you but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight

Bring it on down, bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank, your body and your mind can't breathe
Bring it on down, bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank, your body and your mind can't breathe

You're the outcast
You're the underclass
But you don't care
Because you're living fast

And you're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking about you but you don't know who
I'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight 
You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
Cos in the sun they say it's fun
If you can get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
Cos in a car you can go far
Just depends on what kind of car you are

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
She said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
She didn't half talk a lot
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
With my big house and my big car
And all my friend are there at the bar

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
Cos in the sun they say it's fun
If you can get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
Cos in a car you can go far
It just depends on what kind of car you are

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
Here's a thought for every man who tries to understand
What is in his hands (what's in his hands)
He walks along the open road of love and life
Surviving if he can (surviving if he can)

Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

As they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

Here's a thought for every man who tries to understand
What is in his hands (what's in his hands)
He walks along the open road of love and life
Surviving if he can (but only if he can)

Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

As they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)
As they took his soul they stole his pride (pride)

As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow 
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova

'Cause people believe
That they're gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round, we don't know why
Why, why, why, why

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova, a champagne supernova

'Cause people believe
That they're gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round, we don't know why
Why, why, why, why

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high 
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I'll start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger", I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
But please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger", I heard you say

So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger", I heard you say
So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"
I heard you say

"At least not today" 
I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says "hello"

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says

Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)
Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)
Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)
Hello, hello, hello 
I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I've gotta say time's slippin' away
And what will it hold for me?
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you?
You're standing ignoring me

I thought that I heard someone say now
"There's no time for running away now"
Hey now, hey now

Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame

The first thing I saw as I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know that I want you to know
What's written inside of your head
And time as it stands won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?

I thought that I heard someone say now
"There's no time for running away now"
Hey now, hey now

Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame

I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I've gotta say time's slippin' away
And what will it hold for me?
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you?
You're standing ignoring me

I thought that I heard someone say now
"There's no time for running away now"
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now

Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
'Cause time's no chain
Feel no shame
