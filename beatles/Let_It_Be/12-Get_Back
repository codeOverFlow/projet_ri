Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last

For some California grass Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Ooo, get back Jo Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming

But she gets it while she can Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Wearing her high heel shoes
And a low neck sweater
