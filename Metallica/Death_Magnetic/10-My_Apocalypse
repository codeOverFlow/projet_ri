Claustrophobic, crawl out of this skin
High explosive, reach and pull that pin
Fear thy name extermination
Desecrating hail of fire

So we cross that line
Into the crypt, total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision, prophecy reveal
Death magnetic, pulling closer still
Fear thy name annihilation
Desolating hail of fire

So we cross that line
Into the crypt, total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse, go!

Crushing metal ripping skin
Tossing body mannequins
Spilling blood bleeding gas

Mangled flesh snapping spines
Dripping bloody valentine
Shattered face spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Split
Spit it out!

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know what time to cross over?
Want to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, the bones they are rattled
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, the bones they all shatter
It's past time to see the end in me
See the end in me!

Claustrophobic, climb out of this skin
High explosive, reach and pull that pin
Violate, annihilate, lose into my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate, if not accept, deny

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny in hail of fire

So we cross that line
Into the crypt, total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrants awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse
