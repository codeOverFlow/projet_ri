Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat.
Like a face that learned to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray.
Like an endless nightmare that I must waken from each day.
Like Contradiction, a premonition
Now worthy of, so I deny...... I deny.

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace.
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by.
I open just in time to say goodbye.

Almost like your life.
Almost like your endless fight.
Cursed, the day is long.
Realize you don't belong.

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now.
Almost like your fight.
And there it went, almost like your life.

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think.
Like a raging river, drowning when I only need a drink.
Like a poison that I swallow
But I want the world to die.

Like a release from prison that I didn't know I was in.
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then,
Like a general without a mission
Until the war will start again...... start again.

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place.
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace.
I blind my eyes, I Hide and feel it passing me by,
I open just in time to say goodbye.

Almost like your life.
Almost like your endless fight.
Cursed, the day is long.
Realize you don't belong,

Disconnect somehow.
Never stop complaining now,
Almost like your fight.
And there it went almost like your life.

Like a touch from hell
To feel how hot that it can get if you get caught.
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees.

Like a touch from hell
To feel how hot that it can get if I get caught.
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees.

Almost like your life.
Almost like your endless fight.
Cursed, the day is long.
Realize you don't belong,

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now.
Almost like your fight.
And there it went, almost like your life.
That was just your life.
