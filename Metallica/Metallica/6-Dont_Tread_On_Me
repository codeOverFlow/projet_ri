Don't tread on me
So don't tread on me

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage

So don't tread on me

So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore

[Incomprehensible]
Don't tread on me

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lightning strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
Eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Ooh, no, no, no
So don't tread on me

So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore

Don't tread on me

So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail

So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore

Don't tread on me
