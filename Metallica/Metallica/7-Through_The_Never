All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see
Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending

Limitations of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah

Twisting, turning through the never
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever twisting, turning
Through the never

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth, no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason

Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah

Twisting, turning through the never
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever twisting, turning
Through the never

On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out to the

Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then ever comes

Twisting, turning through the never
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever twisting, turning

Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning
Through the never
Never
